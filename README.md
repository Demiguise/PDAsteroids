===========

So this project is essentially the by-product of me realising I need to make a game to test/improve the interfaces throughout the engine I've designed. So far, there's been quite a few changes to how everything works and interacts with each-other. Most of which is down to me finding the singleton design pattern just a little more frustrating than I'd like. 

However, this is still a learning exercise and one that I'm quite enjoying. Once this is complete I'll be writing post-mortem based on the notes,commits and illegible drawings I've done during development.

Please take no mind of the sparing use of commits, I sometimes work on things for a good while and like to have things work 'Stably' before syncing to GIT.
